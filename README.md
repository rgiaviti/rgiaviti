# 👋 **Hello! I'm Ricardo Giaviti** 🚀

I'm a **software developer** with a focus on backend services, microservices, integration, and REST APIs. I work with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Typescript, and Rust. I'm also well-versed in frameworks like Spring, Quarkus, FastAPI, and Ruby on Rails.

I have a passion for **experimenting with new technologies** and consider myself an early adopter. Currently, I'm working as a **Full Stack Developer** handling backend services, front-end development with React and Typescript, infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, and CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

## **Coding Enthusiast** 🧙‍♂️

Coding is my craft, and I love diving into the technical details to build innovative solutions. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to apply my coding skills to create better digital experiences.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories, and let's collaborate on exciting projects together!

✨ **Let's make some great code together!** 🚀
